    "description": "After a steady stream of live shows throughout the Puget Sound region, Planet of Giants enlisted the help of David Minor at Chartreuse Muffin Studios (Shoreline, Wa) to record 2015’s less Low-fi but no less rockin’ LP, “That Electric Sound”. The album captures the intensity, energy, and emotion that Planet of Giants bring to their live shows.",

    "description": "After years of playing together in various South Puget Sound bands, Baldwin and Thompson came together in 2012 with one goal in mind: create stripped down, raw, powerful rock and roll tunes that get bodies moving. Thus, Planet of Giants was born. 2013 saw the release of the band’s first EP, the erroneously titled “E.P. Dos”. Nikki McCoy of the Weekly Volcano (Tacoma, Wa) praised the EP for its “low-fi, stripped down, blues and rock and roll sound”.",
